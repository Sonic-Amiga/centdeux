Kromaine13: Understand.
The status reg. F144 & F145 are going to need to be
figured out with the Hawk & disk controller using TOS.
Reading both F144 & F145 with the Hawk "Write Protect" On then Off
will tell you the Write Protect bit position,
then send a large seek command then quickly read in F144 & F145
should see a bit position change for "Not On Cylinder"
then flip back after a few hundred ms the other way,
then you could seek the drive to cylinder (0x02 seek)
do a (0x00 read) check status F144 & F145
next change sector address to new cylinder but do not do a seek command
then do a read causing a "sector address error" bit to show up in F144 & F145.
This is only way I can think of to map out the F144 & F145 status reg.
